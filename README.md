===========

Poor mans proxy rules management solution.

I will expand on this as I figure out exactly what I need this to do.  
I will start with it being a tool to manage the configurations across 
multiple Bluecoat proxies when there is no Bluecoat Director server in place.
I may create a similar tool to manage Palo Alto's via thier API.
more to come soon
